# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains my work for an Intro to AI class, where I explored, trained, and evaluated several supervised learning models on a given dataset. The primary goal was to compare different algorithms in terms of **accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency**.  

The repo demonstrates the complete ML workflow:  
1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
2. Training multiple machine learning models  
3. Hyperparameter tuning  
4. Model evaluation & comparison  
5. Reporting insights  

## 🛠️ Models Implemented  

- 🌳 **Decision Tree (DT)**  
- 🔗 **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 📈 **Logistic Regression**
- 🧑‍🤖 **Neural Networks**
- 🔍 **Heuristic Search Approaches**

## 📦 Technologies Used  

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization and performance plots  
- **scikit-learn**
